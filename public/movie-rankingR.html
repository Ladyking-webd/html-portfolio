<h1>My Top 3 Movie/Series Recommendations – Ruby</h1>

<h2>They're 3 movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Straw</h3>
<p>This movie touched me deeply. 
It’s one of the most emotional films I’ve ever watched.
I cried throughout the entire story. It brings out raw emotions, vulnerability,
and reminds us how fragile life and human relationships can be.
I recommend it to anyone who needs a reminder of how powerful empathy can be.</p>

<h3>The Sinners</h3>
<p>This film really got me thinking. It has a dark,
mysterious vibe, and a part of it feels strangely real. 
Honestly, I believe vampires might truly exist and walk among us.
The story explores themes of secrets, hidden identities, 
and the line between good and evil. It’s chilling, but so fascinating.</p>

<h3>The Hate U Give</h3>
<p>This is a powerful and emotional film about racial injustice.
    It tells the story of a Black teenager who finds her voice after witnessing police violence.
    The film reflects the reality that many Black communities face — and it does it with raw truth and emotional power.</p>
