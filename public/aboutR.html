<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Ruby King, passionate entrepreneur and founder of KOLTIZ, a dynamic company based in Haiti.
My journey is marked by a constant desire to innovate, to serve my community and to offer useful services,<br>
accessible and quality. From swimming to vehicle rental, including the sale of wellness products and travel accessories,<br>
 my goal remains the same: to create concrete solutions for everyday needs. </p>


<p>With a motivated team, composed mainly of women, I was able to develop a structure that highlights the beauty of Haiti,
   its strength and human potential. Through KOLTIZ Swimming Club, I teach children and adults to swim safely,<br>
    while working with schools and institutions to make swimming a right, not a luxury. My approach is based on inclusion,<br>
     respect and professionalism. </p>

<p>
  <ul>Over the years, I have diversified my projects, while maintaining a clear guideline:
  <li>value local talents</li>
  <li>promote the autonomy of women</li>
  <li>offer a remarkable customer experience</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>I believe in the power of a job well done, positive energy and lasting impact. This is just the beginning of a long journey,<br>
   and I am proud to walk with integrity and ambition. </p>
